# What this is
This is a incomplete 2D toy action RGPG game project I wrote in 2021 after working through the 2nd edition of Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ and learncpp.com. 

# Context
My main goals were to learn about concepts such as using external libraries, 2d graphics, collisions, pathfinding, controls, loading and using asset files, data structures, and gameplay implementation.
It was a lot of fun writing this. It was my first software project, and I do not recomend using this as a reference :)

# Libraries & Files
The project relies on libraries such as nlohmann json,fmt, and plf_colony which are not included in this repository.  Graphics files used for character sprites and tilesets are also not included.
